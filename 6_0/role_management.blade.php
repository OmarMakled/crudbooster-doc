    <h1>Role Management</h1>

    <p>You can limit a user access with role management. As a default, each user in CRUDBooster have to relate to a role. </p>
    <p>To make a role, enter Developer Area > Manage Roles > Add Role</p>
    <p>There are 5 types of privilege. Browse, Create, Read, Update and Delete.</p>
    <p>And you don't need to make a code to prevent a user manually. All those things are handled by CRUDBooster.</p>
